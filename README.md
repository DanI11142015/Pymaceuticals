Summary: 

You've just joined Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications. Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

As a senior data analyst at the company, you've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

The executive team has tasked you with generating all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study. They have also asked you for a top-level summary of the study results.


Analysis: 
  from our intial summary of Drug Regimen we confirm that Ketapril was used to treat large tumors in mice and a large standard descrapncy overall according to our standard error of mean. 
  Capomulin and Ramicane were the most promising treatments out the our study. Our random sample of mouse M957 shows that that there was signifcant turmor shrinkage with Capomulin treamtent spanning over a 40 day time period.
